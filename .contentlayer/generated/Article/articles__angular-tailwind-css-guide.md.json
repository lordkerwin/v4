    "raw": "\nSo, I've found a lot of crappy guides on the internet about how to integrate TailwindCSS with Angular 8, a lot of them involve some nasty hacks that I think are basically, shit. I've collated some information from various sources online to show you how I go about implementing TailwindCSS with Angular 8. If you're reading this and you don't know what TailwindCSS is, two things, one, where the hell have you been the past few years and two, go to tailwindcss.com and feast in the amazingness (is that even a word) that is Tailwind.\n\nWe'll be utilising the @angular-builders/custom-webpack package which will essentially allow us to tailor the webpack build to add tailwind into the build process.\n\nFirst things first, install the following:\n\n`npm i tailwindcss postcss-scss postcss-import postcss-loader @angular-builders/custom-webpack -D\n`\n\nNext you need to open up your Angular project, I'm going to assume you're using sass, as well, why the fuck not?\n\nOpen your `styles.scss` file and add the following at the top.\n\n```\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\n```\n\nNext, you need to create the tailwind config file, to do so, open your terminal and smash in the following (inside the directory of your app of course).\n\n`npx tailwind init`\n\nNow we need to extend the webpack config, first, start by creating `webpack.config.js` at the root of your project, this is what it should look like\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n    module: {\n        rules: [\n            {\n                test: /\\.scss$/,\n                loader: 'postcss-loader',\n                options: {\n                    ident: 'postcss',\n                    syntax: 'postcss-scss',\n                    plugins: () => [\n                        require('postcss-import'),\n                        require('tailwindcss'),\n                        require('autoprefixer'),\n                    ]\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n};\n```\n\nOnce you've added that, modify the `angular.json` file to tell it to use the custom builder and config file.\n\n```\n{\n  \"architect\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"customWebpackConfig\": {\n          \"path\": \"./webpack.config.js\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"serve\": {\n      \"builder\": \"@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server\",\n      \"options\": {\n        \"customWebpackConfig\": {\n          \"path\": \"./webpack.config.js\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow we're all up and ready to rumble, add some tailwind classes to an object and run\n\n`npm start`\n\n_Extra_\n\nThe whole point of Tailwind is to create custom utilities, you can do so by doing the following:\n\nModify your `styles.scss` and add 2 new custom imports.\n\n```\n@import 'tailwindcss/base';\n@import 'tailwindcss/components';\n@import './custom-tailwind/custom-components.css'; // added\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities';\n@import './custom-tailwind/custom-utilities.css'; // added\n```\n\nMake sure that they're added in the exact order above.\n\nYou can now create a folder inside the src directory called `custom-tailwind`\nInside this, you create the 2 files the same names as above, now you can create custom reusable utilities and components, for example:\n\n`custom-components.css`\n\n```\n.btn {\n  @apply px-4;\n  @apply py-2;\n  @apply rounded;\n  @apply bg-indigo-500;\n  @apply text-white;\n  transition: 200ms;\n}\n\n.btn:hover {\n  @apply bg-indigo-600;\n}\n```\n\nAnd now anywhere you want a button, just give it the class `.btn` and it will apply all the tailwind classes.\n\nFor `custom-utilities.css`, you can do the following:\n\n```\n.rotate-0 {\n    transform: rotate(0deg);\n}\n.rotate-90 {\n    transform: rotate(90deg);\n}\n.rotate-180 {\n    transform: rotate(180deg);\n}\n.rotate-270 {\n    transform: rotate(270deg);\n}\n```\n\nAnd now anywhere, you can just call these classes. Neat huh!\n\nEnjoy the power that is TailwindCSS + Angular 8!\n\n**Update:**\n\nI realise this is a repeated post, for some reason I had 3 dev.to accounts (god knows why) and this is the account I wanted to use, so I deleted this post along with the other account and re-created it here.\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nThis also works the same way with Angular 9, I have this working using angular version `\"@angular/core\": \"~9.0.0\",`\n\n**Update 3: Angular 10.X**\n\npostcss-loader came with some _breaking changes_ when it jumped from version 3 to 4.\n\nI managed to get Angular 10 and Tailwind to play nicely by changing my `webpack.config.js` to the following:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.scss$/,\n        loader: 'postcss-loader',\n        options: {\n-          ident: 'postcss',\n-          syntax: 'postcss-scss',\n-          plugins: () => [\n-            require('postcss-import'),\n-            require('tailwindcss'),\n-            require('autoprefixer'),\n-          ],\n+          postcssOptions: {\n+           ident: 'postcss',\n+            syntax: 'postcss-scss',\n+            plugins: [\n+              require('postcss-import'),\n+              require('tailwindcss'),\n+              require('autoprefixer'),\n            ],\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThanks to [@phileagleson](https://github.com/notiz-dev/notiz/issues/111#issuecomment-689249664) for spotting this!\n\nYou can also skip the entire above process and just the the **Schematic** that was created to do the work for you.\n\n[garygrossgarten/ngx-tailwind](https://github.com/garygrossgarten/ngx-tailwind)\n\nNote, you will still need to change the `webpack.config.js` even if you use the Schematic when using this with `postcss-loader` Version 4 and Angular 10\n\n## Update\n\nThanks to [thieugiatri4492](https://dev.to/thieugiatri4492) for pointing out that if you used my manual method of installing Tailwind, and then moved over to use the schematic, you'll need to remove the webpack.config.js before using the schematic otherwise it will throw an error that it already exists!\n",
