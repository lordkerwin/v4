            I&apos;ve been a full-stack web developer for quite some time now. I
            have a passion for front-end development to create the best possible
            user experience. I&apos;ve been writing code since the days of
            MySpace (yes, it&apos;s true) and I am constantly learning new
            technologies and best practices to improve my skills.
          </p>

          <div>
            I have used a plethora of frameworks and languages over the years,
            but here are some of the technologies I&apos;ve been working with
            recently:
            <ul className="marker:text-pink-900">
              <li>TypeScript</li>
              <li>React + Next</li>
              <li>Vue + Nuxt</li>
              <li>TailwindCSS</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <hr className="w-20 border-pink-900" />
          <p>
            When I&apos;m not coding away on the latest web project, I love to
            spend time with my family. I have a wife and three beautiful
            daughters who keep me on my toes, and I wouldn&apos;t have it any
            other way. I am also a dog lover and have a furry companion who I
            enjoy spending time with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in maintaining a good work-life balance, and make sure to
            make time for the things that matter most in life, which for me, is
            my family.
          </p>
