This is a relatively short guide, and it's just to show how easy it is to implement [day.js](https://day.js.org/) inside a Nuxt app.

I've always just used Moment.js for date formatting, but since Moment.js has now been abandoned and they're encouraging people to use alternatives, I needed to find a way to convert timestamps that are provided by the API's I consume. They usually return timestamps in the following format:

```js
2020-10-08T07:51:58Z
```

Which to be honest, isn't really useful to anyone. That's where day.js comes in, it can convert the timestamp above into something like

```js
Oct 8th 2020
```

It's pretty simple to do.

First we need to pull in the `@nuxtjs/dayjs` package with the following command.

```bash
yarn add @nuxtjs/dayjs
or
npm install @nuxtjs/dayjs
```

Once that is installed, open up your `nuxt.config.js` and add
`'@nuxtjs/dayjs'` to the `modules` section, and then outside of that, add the following `dayjs` object.

```js
modules: [
    '@nuxtjs/dayjs',
    ...
],
dayjs: {
    locales: ['en'],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    plugins: ['relativeTime', 'advancedFormat'],
},
```

Set any _locales_ you want, for me, being in the United Kingdom, I set my locale to `en` and then add any additional dayjs plugins you need. I'm using the [RelativeTime](https://day.js.org/docs/en/plugin/relative-time) and [AdvancedFormat](https://day.js.org/docs/en/plugin/advanced-format) plugins.

Once everything is installed, you from within any component you can do the following

```js
{
  {
    $dayjs("2020-10-08T07:51:58Z").format("MMM Do YYYY");
  }
}
```

Which will output this

```js
Oct 8th 2020
```

You can also use the RelativeTime plugin to turn it into this:

```js
{
  {
    $dayjs("2020-10-08T07:51:58Z").fromNow();
  }
}
```

Which will return

`a year ago`

You can obviously, not use hard-coded dates and use props/variables such as

```js
{
  {
    $dayjs(post.published_at).fromNow();
  }
}
```

Day.js is a simple and ultra-lightweight replacement for Moment.js and is super easy to use.
