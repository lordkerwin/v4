So, I'm an avid Apple Mac user, and I've used macOS as my primary dev environment for over 10 years.

This has been mostly down to that my employer provided me with a top end Macbook Pro, so I have done everything within the apple ecosystem.

My current employer, the boss was pretty cool, I could set my mac's up how I wanted, have personal emails/icloud on it, use it for personal stuff and side-work (out of work hours ofcourse), So I've had no real reason to switch.

I have just taken a new job, and decided that I want my own machine, keep work and personal stuff separated.

Dell were doing an amazing deal on their outlet website for the XPS range of laptops, and I managed to pickup a brand-new XPS 13 9305 with 16GB Ram, and i7 Quad Core, with 512GB M2 SSD, for Â£800.

The only problem is that it came with Windows 10 Home edition. I tried to use Windows with WSL2, but felt like it was a fight to get even the basics to work. Windows lasted less than a day on the laptop before I decided to install Linux.

I've used Mint/Ubuntu before, and I know of System76 (who make awesome Linux machines by the way!) System76 also have developed Pop!\_OS, a Ubuntu/Debian based OS that is, well, fucking amazing!

It's aimed at developers and is built from the ground up with that in mind. The keyboard shortcuts for multi-tasking is outstanding. I love the tile-view that comes and the global launcher/search makes me feel right at home, just like macOS and its Spotlight.

Now, for installing it on the XPS, it was a simple case of heading over to the Pop!\_OS website and grabbing the correct ISO that you need.

I grabbed the 21.04 Non Nvidia version (as my laptop just has the Intel Iris XE graphics). Create a bootable USB and installed it on the XPS.

Aside from turning safe-boot off in the BIOS of the XPS, I did nothing else. Followed the on-screen instructions when installing the OS, I wiped my SSD and only have PopOS! as my main operating system.

Once it was installed, I opened the Pop!\_Shop to let it check for updates and install them.

So far, I've been running PopOS! for over a week, and haven't had a single issue.

I have the XPS plugged via USB-C to DisplayPort for a Iiyama 34" Ultrawide running at 144hz, and a Seagate Barracuda Gaming Dock via Thunderbolt (Which has a 4TB Spinning drive and a 512GB M2-SSD inside it) and everything is working perfectly.

I have things like Docker, PHP, Node, Jetbrains (WebStorm, PhpStorm and DataGrip), Visual Studio Code, Mailspring (For emails) and it even plays nicely with my Corsair Virtuso Headset.

I could seriously see Pop!\_OS replacing my Mac as a daily driver.

I've never had such a great experience with a Linux distro before.
